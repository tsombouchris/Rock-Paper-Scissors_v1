# Rock-Paper-Scissors_v1
This is a rock paper scissors game between the user end the CPU(implemented in python)

When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again (should be a loop)
Use the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module to make a choice for CPU player(computer).
Print both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
Check both player's moves: 
If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends. 
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game from step 3
